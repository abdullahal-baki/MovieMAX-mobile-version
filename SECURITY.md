# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please avoid opening public issues for security-sensitive reports.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled for the repo).

If advisories are not available, open a minimal issue describing the impact and
request a private channel.
